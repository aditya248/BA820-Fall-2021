1
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,623
Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,460
But she had an enchantment upon her
of a fearful sort,

3
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:03,465
which could only be broken
by Love's first kiss.

4
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:10,054
She was locked away in a castle
guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon.

5
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:17,477
Many brave knights had attempted to free her
from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

6
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:24,483
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest
room of the tallest tower for her true love

7
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,737
and true love's first kiss.

8
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,197
Like that's ever going to happen.

9
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,367
What a loony.

10
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,452
Somebody once told me

11
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:39,371
The world is gonna roll me

12
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:42,707
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

13
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,626
She was looking kind of dumb

14
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,711
With her finger and her thumb

15
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:52,298
In the shape of
an "L" on her forehead

16
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,509
Well, the years start coming

17
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,760
And they don't stop coming

18
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,261
Fed to the rules and
I hit the ground running

19
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:00,348
Didn't make sense
not to live for fun

20
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,849
Your brain gets smart
but your head gets dumb

21
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,101
So much to do, so much to see

22
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:07,020
So what's wrong with
taking the back streets

23
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,689
You'll never know
if you don't go

24
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,607
You'll never shine
if you don't glow

25
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,693
Hey now, you're an all star

26
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,777
Get your game on, go play

27
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,862
Hey now, you're a rock star

28
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,781
Get the show on, get paid

29
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:24,118
And all that glitters is gold

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,540
Only shooting stars
break the mold

31
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,458
It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,710
You're bundled up now

33
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:34,961
Wait 'til you get older

34
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,046
But the meteor men beg to differ

35
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:38,715
Judging by the hole
in the satellite picture

36
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,799
The ice we skate
is getting pretty thin

37
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,467
The water's getting warm

38
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:43,719
So you might as well swim

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,803
My world's on fire,
how about yours

40
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,305
That's the way I like it
and I never get bored
--Beware--

41
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:50,891
Hey now, you're an all star

42
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,394
Get your game on, go play

43
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,061
Hey now, you're a rock star

44
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,564
Get the show on, get paid

45
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:00,900
All that glitters is gold

46
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:06,322
Only shooting stars
break the mold

47
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:18,332
Hey now, you're an all star

48
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,500
Get your game on, go play
--Stay out--

49
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,419
Hey now, you're a rock star

50
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:25,921
Get the show on, get paid

51
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,841
All that glitters is gold

52
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:33,845
Only shooting stars
break the mold

53
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,018
I think he's in there.

54
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:42,311
All right. Lets get it!

55
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,313
Hold on.
Do you know what
that thing can do to you?

56
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:49,817
Yeah. He'll grind your bones
for his bread.

57
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,445
Well actually
that would be a giant.

58
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:56,657
Now Ogres, huh,
they are much worse.

59
00:03:56,907 --> 00:04:01,077
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,038
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

61
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,749
Actually,
it's quite good on toast.

62
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,209
Back, back beast, back!

63
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,797
I warned you!

64
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:19,217
Right.

65
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:36,233
This is the part,
where you run away.

66
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:40,778
Yeah!

67
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:47,282
And stay out.

68
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:53,706
Wanted.
Fairytale creatures.

69
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:02,755
Right, this one is full.
Take it away.

70
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,550
Give me that.

71
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,553
Your fine days are over.
-25 pieces of silver for the witch.

72
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,850
Next.
-Come on.

73
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,020
Sit down there!
And be quiet!

74
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,438
This cage is so small.

75
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,897
You wouldn't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.
I can change.

76
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,441
Please, give me another chance.

77
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,443
Oh, shut up!

78
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:28,485
Next.

79
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,279
What do we got?

80
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,030
This little wooden puppet.

81
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:36,452
I'm not a puppet,
I'm a real boy.

82
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,870
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

83
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,872
No! Please, don't let them do it!

84
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,497
Next. What do you got?

85
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:45,792
Well, I've got a talking donkey!

86
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:46,877
Right.

87
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,172
Well that's good for ten schillings,
if you can prove it.

88
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:54,925
Oh, go ahead fella.

89
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:56,343
Well?

90
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,803
He's just a li...,
just a little nervous.

91
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,514
He's really quite a chatterbox.

92
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:02,807
You boneheaded donkey!

93
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,308
That's it.
I have heard enough. Guards!

94
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,353
No, no, he talks, he does!

95
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,063
I can talk.
I love to talk.

96
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:13,816
I've talked to...

97
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:19,947
Get her out of my sight!
-No, no, I swear!

98
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,328
Hey, I can fly.
-He can fly! -He can fly!

99
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,205
He can talk!
-That's right, fool!

100
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:32,207
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey!

101
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,834
You might have seen house fly,

102
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,834
maybe even a super fly.

103
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,837
But I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly!

104
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,260
Seize him!

105
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:04,986
Get him! This way! Hurry!

106
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:11,241
You there. Ogre.
-I.

107
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:12,993
By the order of lord Farquaad.

108
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,578
I am authorized to place you
both under arrest.

109
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:21,834
And transport you to a designated
resettlement facility.

110
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,544
Oh really?

111
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:28,673
You and what army?

112
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,681
Can I say something to you?

113
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,143
Listen, you were really, really something,
back there. Incredible.

114
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:45,396
Are you talking to...

115
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,773
...me?

116
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,274
Yes, I was talking to you.

117
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,068
Can I just tell you that you were
really great back there
with those guards.

118
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:53,153
They thought that was all over there.

119
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:54,987
And then you showed up and BAM.

120
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,072
There was tripping
on over themselves like babes in the woods.

121
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,866
That really made me
feel good to see that.

122
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:00,159
Oh, that's great.
Really.

123
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:01,451
Man, it's good to be free.

124
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:07,539
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends?

125
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:09,333
But I...

126
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,876
I don't have any friends.

127
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,502
And I'm not going out there by myself.

128
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,046
Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...

129
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,464
I'll stick with you.

130
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:17,882
You and me in green fighting machine.

131
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,511
Together we'll scare the spin
if anybody crosses us.

132
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,474
Oh, a, that was really scary.

133
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,434
Maybe you don't mind me saying.

134
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,102
If that don't work,
your breath will certainly
do the job done, 'cause...

135
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,520
you definitively need some
tic-tac or something,

136
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,106
'cause your breath stinks!

137
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,900
Man you've ???  my note!

138
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,652
Just like the time...

139
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:42,236
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

140
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,613
Man I had some strong gases leaking
out of my but that day.

141
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:48,408
Why are you following me?

142
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,828
I'll tell you why.

143
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,081
'Cause I'm all alone,

144
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:58,209
there is no one here, beside me.

145
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:05,382
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

146
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:10,386
But you got to have free ...
-Stop singing!

147
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:13,222
Well, it's no wonder,
you don't have any friends.

148
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,016
Wow! Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

149
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,642
Listen! Little donkey.

150
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,813
Take a look at me! What am I?

151
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,148
Ah...

152
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,108
...really tall?

153
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:31,696
No! I'm an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.

154
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,991
Doesn't that bother you?

155
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,866
Nope.

156
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,161
Really?
-Really really.

157
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,246
Oh?

158
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,455
Man, I like you.
What's your name?

159
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:45,875
Ah..., Shrek.

160
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,585
Shrek?!

161
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:48,752
But do you know,
what I like about you, Shrek?

162
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:51,754
You've got that kind of:
"I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.

163
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:57,384
I like that, I respect that, Shrek.
You're all right.

164
00:09:57,594 --> 00:09:59,262
Uh, look at that.

165
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,555
Who would wanna live in
a place like that?

166
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:04,016
That would be my home.

167
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:09,020
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

168
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,689
It's amazing what you did
with such a modest budget.

169
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:18,153
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

170
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,865
I guess, you don't
entertain much, do you?

171
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:24,908
I like my privacy.

172
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,201
You know I do to.
That's another thing, we have in common.

173
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,329
Like I hate it when you got somebody
in your face.

174
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,997
You try to give them a hint
and they won't leave.

175
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,376
And then there's that big occurred silence,
you know?

176
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,087
Can I stay with you?

177
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,379
-What?

178
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,215
Can I stay with you,
please.

179
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:43,967
Of course!

180
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:44,842
-Really?

181
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,094
No.

182
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,178
-Please! I don't want to go back there.

183
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,512
You don't know how is like
to be considered a freak.

184
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:52,349
Well..., maybe you do.
But that's why we have to stick together!

185
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,643
You got to let me stay!
Please! Please!

186
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,019
OK, OK.

187
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:59,605
-But one night only.
-Huh, thank you!

188
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:01,023
A, what are you do... No!

189
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:03,817
This is going to be fun.
We can stay up late,
swap the manly stories.

190
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,194
And in the morning...

191
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,363
I'll make waffles.

192
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,365
Where do I sleep?

193
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:13,116
Outside!

194
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,619
Oh, a, I guess that's cool.

195
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,287
I don't know you and
you don't know me...

196
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,164
... so I guess, outside is best, you know.

197
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:22,959
Here I go.

198
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,507
Good night.

199
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,426
I do like that half door.
I'm a donkey all alone outside.

200
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:38,682
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

201
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:46,813
I'm all alone,
there's no one here beside me.

202
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:54,914
-I thought, I told you to stay outside.
-I am outside.

203
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:02,879
Well James. This is far from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

204
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:06,466
It's not home, but we'll do just fine.

205
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,009
What a lovely bed.
-Got you!

206
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:14,639
I found some cheese.
Awful stuff.

207
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,932
-Is that you Gordon?
-How did you know?

208
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:23,230
Enough!
What are you doing in my house?

209
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,232
Oh, no, no, no...
Death prod off the table!

210
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:31,528
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed's taken.

211
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:33,822
What?

212
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:37,408
I live in a swamp.
I've put up signs.

213
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,826
I'm a terrifying Ogre!

214
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:44,831
What do I have to do,
to get a little privacy?

215
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:53,088
Oh, no! No, no!

216
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:07,017
What are you doing in my swamp?

217
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:15,650
All right, get out of here. All of you.
Move it! Come on, let's go.

218
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:18,403
And hurry up, hurry up.

219
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:24,533
No, no, not there. Not there!

220
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,161
Hey don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

221
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:31,038
Oh gosh, no one invited us.
-What?

222
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,707
We were forced to come here.
-By who?

223
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,500
Lord Farquaad.

224
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,671
He hoofed and he bopped
and signed a conviction notice.

225
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,172
All right.

226
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:47,677
Who knows where this
Farquaad guy is?

227
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
Oh I do.
I know where he is.

228
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:55,143
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

229
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,979
-Anyone at all?
-Me. -Anyone?

230
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:02,023
Oh pick me,
I know! Me, me.

231
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:04,609
Ok, fine.

232
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:09,738
Attention all fairy tale things!

233
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:13,742
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially warned up.

234
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:17,953
In fact.
I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now

235
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,373
and get all off my land
and back where you came from.

236
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:34,384
You.
You're coming with me.

237
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:35,802
All right.
That's what I like to hear, man.

238
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:41,933
Shrek and Donkey,
two stubborn friends off on a
world and big city adventure. I love it.

239
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:47,521
I'm on road again.
Sing with me Shrek!
I'm on road again...

240
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,940
What did I say about singing?

241
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,066
-Can I whistle?
-No.

242
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:56,362
-Well, can I hummer?
-All right.

243
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:29,849
That's enough.
He's ready to talk.

244
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:43,736
Run, run, run as fast as you can,
you can't catch me.

245
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,154
I'm the gingerbread man.

246
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,656
You're a monster.

247
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,449
I'm not a monster here. You are.

248
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,245
You and the rest of that fairytale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

249
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,289
-Now tell me! Where are the others?

250
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:57,498
-Eat me.

251
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:01,751
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.

252
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:04,629
Now my patience has reached its end!

253
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:05,881
-Tell me! Or I'll...

254
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,381
-No, no, not the buttons.

255
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:08,424
Not gumdrop buttons.

256
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,593
All right! Who's hiding them?

257
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,137
Ok, I'll tell you.

258
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:15,890
-Do you know the muffin-man?

259
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:17,557
The muffin-man?

260
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,808
-The muffin-man.

261
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,059
Yes, I know the muffin-man.

262
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,019
Who lives on Proully lane?

263
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:25,731
-Well, she's married to the muffin-man.

264
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:26,565
-The muffin-man!

265
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,983
-The muffin-man!

266
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,194
-She's married to the muffin-man.

267
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,361
My lord! We found it.

268
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:38,201
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

269
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,628
Magic mirror.

270
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:56,925
Don't tell him anything!

271
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,928
Evening.

272
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,887
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

273
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,599
Is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

274
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,684
Well, technically,
you're not a king.

275
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:11,395
Ah..., felonious.

276
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,481
-You were saying.
-What I mean is a...

277
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:14,941
...you're not a king, yet.

278
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,192
But you can become one.

279
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,945
All you have to do,
is marry a princess.

280
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:22,072
Go on.

281
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:25,324
So, just sit back
and relax my lord,

282
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:30,370
because it's time for you
to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

283
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:33,665
And here they are.

284
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:38,252
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused
shedding from a kingdom far, far away.

285
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,963
She likes sushi
and hot tubbing anytime.

286
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,383
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for two evil sisters.

287
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:47,552
Please welcome... Cinderella.

288
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:51,263
Bachelorette number two is a
cape wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

289
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,473
Although she lives with seven other man,

290
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:53,932
she is not easy.

291
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:57,644
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips
and find out what a live wife she is.

292
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:01,689
Come on.
Give it up for... Show-white.

293
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:03,858
And last but certainly not least.

294
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,193
Bachelorette number three
is a fire-red head,

295
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:09,320
from a dragon guarded castle,
surrounded by a hot boiling lava.

296
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,738
But don't let that cool you off.

297
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,157
She's a loaded pistol who likes
Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain.

298
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:18,537
Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona.

299
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:22,874
So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?

300
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,293
Or bachelorette number three?

301
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:28,962
-Two... -Three! -Two!

302
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,882
One. No, no, no.

303
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:33,175
Three.
Pick number three my lord.

304
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:36,302
Ok, ok. Number three.

305
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:44,852
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen...
princess Fiona.

306
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,898
She's nice. Fiona.
She's perfect.

307
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,193
All I have to do is just find someone...

308
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,027
But I probably should mention little thing
that happens at night...

309
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,738
-I'll do it!
-Yes, but after sunset...

310
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,488
Silence!

311
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,991
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.

312
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,329
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!

313
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,747
Captain! Assemble your finest man.

314
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,627
We're going to have a tournament!

315
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,629
That's it, that's,
right there, that's Duloc.

316
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,340
I've told you I'll find it.

317
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,219
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.

318
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,387
Aha, that's the place.

319
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:31,975
Do you think maybe he's
compensating for something.

320
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:38,814
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!

321
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,818
-Hey, you!
-No, no!

322
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:44,778
Wait a second.

323
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:50,825
Look, I'm not gonna eat you.
I just...

324
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,397
It's quiet.

325
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:29,859
Too quiet.

326
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,735
Where is everybody?

327
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:37,532
Hey look at this.

328
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:51,752
"Welcome to Du-Duloc,
such a perfect town."

329
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,256
"Here we have some rules,
let us lay them down."

330
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,174
"Don't make waves,
stay in the line,"

331
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:01,178
"and we'll get along fine.
Duloc is the perfect place."

332
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:06,807
"Please keep off the grass,
shine your shoes wipe your ... face."

333
00:22:07,474 --> 00:22:11,060
"Duloc is...
Duloc is..."

334
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:15,106
"Duloc is the perfect town."

335
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,031
Wow!

336
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,784
-Let's do that again.
-No. no.

337
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:42,214
All right.
You're going the right way for smack bottom.

338
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,673
Sorry about that.

339
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,927
That champion should have the honor,
no, no...

340
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:54,516
...the privilege to go forth
and rescue the lovely princess Fiona

341
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:57,477
from the firing keep of the dragon.

342
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:02,438
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

343
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,941
the first runner up
will take his place.

344
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,527
And so on,
and so forth.

345
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:10,529
Some of you may die,

346
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,951
but it's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

347
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,370
Applause.

348
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:24,374
Let the tournament begin.

349
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,587
What is that?

350
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:31,256
Ugh, it's hideous.

351
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:34,383
Oh, that's not very nice.

352
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:36,844
It's just a donkey.

353
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,387
Indeed.

354
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,724
Knights! New plan.
The one, who kills the Ogre,
will be named champion.

355
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,935
Go about him.

356
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:51,273
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

357
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,027
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

358
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:57,611
No?

359
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,698
All right then.

360
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:05,285
Come on.

361
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,625
I don't give a damn
about my reputation

362
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,213
You're living in the past,
it's a new generation

363
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,966
Hey, a girl can do what she wants to do

364
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,468
And that's what I'm gonna do

365
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:27,804
And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation

366
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:30,307
Oh no

367
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:31,975
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

368
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:32,808
Not me

369
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,642
Me, me, me, me, me, me

370
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,019
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!

371
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,938
And I don't give a damn
about my reputation

372
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,691
I never said I wanted
to improve my station

373
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:46,279
And I'm only feeling good
when I'm having fun

374
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,780
And I don't have to please no one
--The chair--!

375
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,866
And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation
--Give him the chair--!

376
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,367
Oh no

377
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,036
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

378
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:55,870
Not me

379
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,538
Me, me, me, me, me, me

380
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,372
Oh no

381
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,207
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

382
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,874
Not me

383
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,542
Me, me, me, me, me, me

384
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,347
Thank you.
Thank you, very much.

385
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:21,767
I'm here until Thursday.
Try to view!

386
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:28,232
Shall I give the order sir?

387
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:32,069
No. I have a better idea.

388
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:37,198
People of Duloc.
I give you our champion!

389
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,366
What?

390
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,493
Congratulation, Ogre.

391
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:45,371
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

392
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,249
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

393
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,126
A quest to get my swamp back!

394
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:53,253
-Your swamp?
-Yeah, my swamp!

395
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:56,923
Where you dumped those
fairytale creatures.

396
00:25:57,132 --> 00:25:58,257
Indeed.

397
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,552
All right Ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

398
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:05,013
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.

399
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,557
Exactly the way it was?

400
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,102
Down to the last slime
covered toad stone.

401
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,604
-And the squatters?
-As good as gone.

402
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:21,236
What kind of quest?

403
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:21,986
Ok, let me get this straight!

404
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:24,113
We gonna go find the dragon

405
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:26,574
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad
will give you back the swamp,

406
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,868
which you only don't have,
'cause he filled it with full of freaks
on the first place.

407
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,702
-Is that about right?
-You know what?

408
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,872
Maybe there is a good reason,
donkeys shouldn't talk.

409
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:35,748
I don't get it Shrek.

410
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,417
Why didn't you just pull
some old Ogre stuff on them?

411
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:39,835
You know, ??? .

412
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:42,337
Grab his bones to make a bridge.
You know the whole Ogre trick.

413
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,965
Oh, you know what.

414
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:48,885
Maybe I could have decapitated
an entire village and
put their heads on plate.

415
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:52,888
Got a knife, cut open their spleens
and drink their fluids.

416
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,849
Does that sound good to you?

417
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,558
A, no, not really, no.

418
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:01,228
For your information,
there is a lot more to Ogres
than people think.

419
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:03,898
-Example.
-Example?

420
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:08,443
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.

421
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:11,196
-They stink?
-Yes, no.

422
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:12,614
-Or, they make you cry.
-No.

423
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,158
Oh, you leave them out on the sun
and they get all brown
and start to spread little white hairs?

424
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,496
No! Layers!
Onions have layers.

425
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:23,790
Ogres have layers.
Onions have layers.

426
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,336
You get it?
We both have layers.

427
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,923
Oh, you both have layers.

428
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,216
You know not everybody likes onions.

429
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,260
Cake! Everybody loves cakes.
Cakes have layers.

430
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,970
I don't care

431
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:42,556
what everyone likes.

432
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:46,643
Ogres are not like cakes.

433
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:50,188
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.

434
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:53,065
Have you ever met a person and you say:
"Hey, let's get some paffe" and

435
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:55,359
they say I don't like paffe.
Paffe is delicious.

436
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:59,947
No! You tensed, irritating,
miniature piece of burden.

437
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,782
Ogres are like onions.
End of story.

438
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,285
Bye, bye.
See you later.

439
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:13,667
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

440
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,418
You know I think I've preferred your humming.

441
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,003
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.

442
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:23,550
Just the word paffe
has made me start sliming

443
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,002
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

444
00:29:04,294 --> 00:29:06,587
Man you got to warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

445
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,880
My mouth was opened and everything.

446
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:12,468
Believe me donkey, if it was me,
you'd be dead.

447
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:16,012
It's brimstone.
We must be getting close.

448
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,598
Yeah, right, brimstone.

449
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:21,893
Don't be talking about brimstone.
I know what I smell and was no brimstone.

450
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:26,438
And they don't come of a stone neither.

451
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:46,371
Sure it's big enough,
but look at the location.

452
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:54,337
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said
that Ogres have layers?

453
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:56,756
Oh, yeah.

454
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:00,175
Well, I have a confession to make.
Donkeys don't have layers.

455
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,511
We wear our fear right
out there in our sleeves.

456
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,887
Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.

457
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:09,391
-You know what I mean.
-Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

458
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,104
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being
on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!

459
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,815
Come on donkey,
I'm right here beside you. Ok?

460
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,651
For emotional support.

461
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:25,196
We'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step after time.

462
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,240
-Really?
-Really really.

463
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,534
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

464
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,662
Just keep moving and don't look down.

465
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,207
Don't look down, don't look down.

466
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:43,879
Shrek! I'm looking down!

467
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,673
I can't do this.
Just let me off right now, please.

468
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:49,134
-But you're already half way.
-Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

469
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:52,095
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

470
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:56,599
Shrek, no, wait.

471
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,851
Don't do that!

472
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:02,104
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

473
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:06,107
-Oh. This?
-Yes, that!

474
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:09,693
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

475
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:14,197
-No, Shrek!
-I'm doing it.

476
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:18,617
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

477
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:25,331
That will do Donkey, that will do.

478
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,879
Cool.

479
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:33,547
So where is this fire
breathing pain in the neck anyway?

480
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,342
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

481
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:41,888
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

482
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:01,489
-Are you afraid?
-No, but shhhhh.

483
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:06,367
Oh, good. Me neither.

484
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:09,245
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.

485
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,914
Here's a..., something
responsible of the situation.

486
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,959
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

487
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,795
I'm sure he's meaner
than a cow or anything,

488
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,046
but they scare.
You know what I mean.

489
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:24,383
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...

490
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:27,928
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

491
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,514
Shut, up.

492
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:33,100
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

493
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,559
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.

494
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:39,979
The princess will be up the stairs in the
highest room in the tallest tower.

495
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:42,399
What makes you think she'll be there?

496
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:44,943
I read it in a book once.

497
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:48,987
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.

498
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:51,781
Oh, I'll find those stairs.
I'll ???. That's right.

499
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,285
Those stairs won't know
which way they go.

500
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,956
The drafting stairs, ???

501
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:04,000
Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.
I'm master of the stairs.

502
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:08,547
I wish I had a stair right here
right here now, I'd step all over it.

503
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,258
Well, at least we know where the princess is.

504
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:17,846
-But where is the...
-Dragon!

505
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:36,528
Donkey, look out!

506
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,789
Got you.

507
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:30,075
Oh, what large teeth you have.

508
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:32,660
I mean, white sparkling teeth.

509
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,829
You probably hear this
all the time from your food, but

510
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,540
you must bleach yourself,
because that is one dazzling smile
you got there.

511
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,502
And do I detect the hint
of minty freshness?

512
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:44,462
And you know what else?

513
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:49,967
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure.
I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

514
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:55,347
'cause you're just ricking
the feminine beauty out.

515
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:59,767
What's the matter with you?
Do you have something in your eye?

516
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,354
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know
I'm a asthmatic and

517
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,524
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

518
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,819
Shrek!

519
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,364
No, Shrek! Shrek!

520
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:48,893
-Wake up!
-What?

521
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,438
Are you princess Fiona?

522
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,439
I am.

523
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,275
Awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

524
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:58,485
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

525
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:00,737
But wait, sir knight.

526
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,864
This be our first meeting.

527
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:06,575
Should it not be wonderful,
romantic moment?

528
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,995
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

529
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:11,371
Hey, what are you doing?

530
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,456
You know, you should
sweep me off my feet.

531
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:17,293
Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed.

532
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,461
You've had a lot of time to plan this,
haven't you?

533
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:24,049
Uh-um.

534
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:26,717
But we have to sing
through this moment.

535
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:29,512
You can recite a poem to me.

536
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:34,058
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretto,
or something.

537
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,809
I don't think so.

538
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,354
Well, can I at least know
the name of my champion?

539
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:43,065
Shrek.

540
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:45,817
So, Shrek.

541
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:50,363
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

542
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:56,494
Thanks.

543
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:02,082
-You didn't slay the dragon?
-It's so much to do this. Now, come on!

544
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,250
But this isn't right.

545
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,503
You torture him,
sword drawn better fight.

546
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,046
That's what all the other knights did.

547
00:37:09,254 --> 00:37:12,173
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.

548
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:15,176
That's not the point.

549
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,761
Wait. Where are you going?
Exit is over there.

550
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,514
Well, I have to save my ass.

551
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,642
What kind of knight are you?

552
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:28,229
One of a kind.

553
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:39,072
...rush into a physical relationship.

554
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,534
I'm not that emotionally ready
for a commitment of a this  magnitude.

555
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:46,160
That was the word I was looking for.
Magnitude.

556
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,831
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

557
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,707
Hey, what are you doing?

558
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,252
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and
take this one step at the time.

559
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:56,713
I mean, we really should
get to know each other first,
you know what am I saying.

560
00:37:56,796 --> 00:38:01,091
As friends, maybe even as pen pals.

561
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:07,555
Hey don't do that.
That's my tail.
That's ma personal tail.

562
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,223
And you're going to tear it off....

563
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:10,891
I don't give permission to

564
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:13,394
Hey, what you want to do that

565
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:19,482
Oh, no. No!

566
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:50,341
-It talks?!
-Yeah. It's getting to shut up,
that's a trick.

567
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,502
Ok, you two.
Head for the exit.

568
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:34,964
I'll take care of the dragon.

569
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:43,221
Ruuuuun!

570
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,846
You did it.
You rescued me.

571
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,392
Amazing, you're wonderful.
You're a ...

572
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,395
...a little unorthodox I admit, but

573
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,108
by deed is great
and by heart is pure.

574
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:47,317
I'm entirely in your debt.

575
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:53,197
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed.

576
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:56,034
I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.

577
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,745
She thinks I'm a steed.

578
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:03,332
The battle is won.
You may remove your helmet good sir knight.

579
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:07,044
-Aah, no.
-Why not?

580
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:08,586
I have helmet hair.

581
00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:11,756
Please.
I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.

582
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:14,467
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

583
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:17,010
But, how will you kiss me?

584
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:21,514
What? That wasn't in a job description.

585
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:25,185
-Maybe it's a perk?
-No. It's destiny.

586
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:27,936
You must know how it goes.

587
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:34,484
A princess locked in a tower and beset
by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.

588
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:38,529
And then they share
true love's first kiss.

589
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,198
With Shrek? You think, wait...

590
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:43,659
...you think Shrek is your true love?

591
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:48,204
Well, yes.

592
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,041
You think that Shrek is your true love.

593
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:54,209
What is so funny?

594
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,961
Let's just say,
I'm not your type, ok?

595
00:41:57,212 --> 00:42:00,798
Of course you are.
You're my rescuer.

596
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:02,966
Now, now remove your helmet.

597
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:05,511
Look.
I really don't think this is a good idea.

598
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:07,429
-Just take off the helmet.
-I'm not going to.

599
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
-Take it off!
-No!

600
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,684
-Now!
-Ok, easy.

601
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:17,229
As you command your highness.

602
00:42:27,363 --> 00:42:30,156
You're an Ogre.

603
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:33,076
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

604
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:37,580
Well, yes, actually.

605
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:42,960
Oh no. This is all wrong.
You're not supposed to be an Ogre.

606
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:48,548
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by lord Farquaad, ok?

607
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,549
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

608
00:42:50,842 --> 00:42:53,094
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?

609
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:56,596
Good question.
You should ask him that,
when we get there.

610
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:59,849
But I have to be rescued
by my true love.

611
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:02,977
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

612
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:04,853
Well so much for noble steed.

613
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:07,648
Look princess.
You're not making my job any easier.

614
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:11,026
Well I'm sorry,
but your job is not my problem.

615
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:16,447
You can tell lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

616
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:18,866
I'll be waiting for him right here.

617
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:22,577
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy,
all right?

618
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,164
-I'm a delivery boy.
-You wouldn't dare.

619
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,915
-You coming donkey?
-Put me down!

620
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,792
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

621
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:34,046
Put me down
or you will suffer the consequences.

622
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:38,632
This is not dignified.
Put me down.

623
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,845
Ok, here's another question.

624
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:43,679
Let's say that a woman 'digged' you,

625
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,305
but you don't really like her, that way.

626
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,432
Now, how you let her down real easy,
so her feelings aren't hurt?

627
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:50,309
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither.
How do you do this?

628
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:52,519
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

629
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,939
Everyone knows it what happens
when you find...

630
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,693
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.

631
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,446
Oh, yeah.
You gonna love it there princess.
It's beautiful.

632
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:07,283
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad.
What's he like?

633
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:10,202
Well, let me put it this way,
princess.

634
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:14,790
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

635
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:19,919
Oh no, Shrek. There are those
who think little of him.

636
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:24,923
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

637
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:26,799
You know, you're just jealous

638
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,635
that you can never measure up
to a great ruler

639
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,345
like lord Farquaad.

640
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:33,347
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess.

641
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:37,308
But I'd like you do that measuring
when you see him tomorrow

642
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,352
Tomorrow?

643
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,270
It will take that long?

644
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:45,816
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
-No. That would take longer.

645
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:46,984
We can keep going.

646
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:50,112
But there are robbers in the woods.

647
00:44:50,403 --> 00:44:53,364
Whoa, time out Shrek.
Camp is definitely something that sounds good.

648
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:57,368
Hey. Come on.
I'm scarier than anything
we're gonna see in this forest.

649
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:01,870
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!

650
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:08,961
Hey, over here.

651
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:13,465
Shrek, we can do better than that.
Now, I don't think this is decent for princess.

652
00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:16,843
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

653
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:21,430
Homey touches? Like what?

654
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:23,472
A door.

655
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,018
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.

656
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,395
Do you want me to come in
and read you a bedtime story,
'cause I will...

657
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:32,732
I said good night!

658
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,985
Shrek! What are you doing?

659
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,570
I just..., you know...

660
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:43,157
Oh, come on,
I was just kidding.

661
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,581
And that one,
that's Throwback.

662
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:54,334
The only Ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

663
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:58,462
Right. Yeah.

664
00:45:58,629 --> 00:46:00,212
Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

665
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:02,465
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.

666
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:05,343
They tell stories. Look.

667
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,470
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"

668
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,889
You can guess what he is famous for.

669
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:11,640
All right.
Now I know you're making this up.

670
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:16,185
No. Look. There he is
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stag.

671
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:20,105
Man, there ain't nothing,
but a bunch of little dots.

672
00:46:20,356 --> 00:46:24,651
You know donkey,
sometimes things are more than they appear.

673
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:30,782
Forget it.

674
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:35,243
Hey Shrek.
What are you gonna do
when we get our swamp back,
anyway?

675
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:39,330
-Our swamp? -You know.
When we're through rescuing the princess
and all that stuff.

676
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:43,417
We? Donkey, there is no we.
There's no our.

677
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,795
There's just me and my swamp.

678
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:50,340
And the first thing I'm gonna do,
is build a ten foot wall around my land.

679
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,095
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.

680
00:46:56,512 --> 00:47:00,975
You know, what I think?
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

681
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:05,144
No, do you think?

682
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:08,564
-Are you hiding something?
-Never mind Donkey.

683
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:11,858
Oh, this is another one of those onion things,
isn't it?

684
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:15,362
No. This is one of those drop it
and leave it alone things.

685
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:58,608
-Why don't you want to talk about it?

686
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,365
Why do you want to talk about it?

687
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,701
-Oh, Why you block?
-I'm not blocking.
-Oh yes you are.

688
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:23,576
-Donkey, I'm warning you.
-Who are you trying to keep out?

689
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:25,037
Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

690
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:27,998
Everyone, ok?

691
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:30,624
-Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

692
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,044
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

693
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:36,422
Hey, what's your problem Shrek?
What do you got against the whole world anyway?

694
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,715
Look. I'm not the one
with the problem, ok?

695
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:41,718
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

696
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:45,887
People take one look at me and go:
AAA... Help! Run!

697
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:50,434
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

698
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,853
They judge me,
before they even know me.

699
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:58,399
That's why I'm better off alone.

700
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:09,575
You know what? When we met,
I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

701
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:15,330
Yeah, I know.

702
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:18,584
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

703
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:23,086
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.

704
00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:28,634
Ok, ok. I see him, now.
Big shining one, right there.
That one, over there?

705
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:33,804
That's the moon.

706
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:59,202
Again. Show me again.

707
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:05,040
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

708
00:49:10,962 --> 00:49:15,215
Perfect.

709
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,857
Yeah. You know I like like that.
Oh come on baby...

710
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:27,194
-Donkey. Wake up.
-What? -Wake up.

711
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:32,449
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

712
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:36,285
-Good morning princess.
-What's all this about?

713
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:40,122
You know, we kind of got of
to a bad start yesterday

714
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:42,207
and I wanted to make it up to you.

715
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:46,628
I mean, after all,
you did rescue me.

716
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,214
Thanks.

717
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:51,883
Well, eat up.

718
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,051
We've got a big day ahead of us.

719
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,475
-Shrek!
-What? It's a compliment.

720
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:05,269
Better out than in
I always say.

721
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:09,064
But that's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

722
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:12,942
-Thanks.
-She's as nasty as you are.

723
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:16,612
You know.
You're not exactly what I've expected.

724
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,116
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

725
00:51:24,118 --> 00:51:27,413
La liberté.

726
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:30,207
Princess!

727
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,084
What are you doing?

728
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,211
Be still mon shery,
for I am your saviour.

729
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:40,633
And I am rescuing you from this green
...beast.

730
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:44,929
Hey! That's my princess.
Go find your own.

731
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:49,431
Please, monster.
Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

732
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:53,936
Look, pal.
I don't know who you think you are.

733
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,854
Oh, of course.
How rude that was.

734
00:51:56,104 --> 00:52:00,400
Please, let me introduce myself.
Oh merry men!

735
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:07,322
Ta, da, da, da, da, da, whoo

736
00:52:07,365 --> 00:52:09,491
I steal from the rich
and give to the needy

737
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,617
He takes a wee percentage,
but I'm not greedy

738
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,704
I rescue pretty damsels,
man, I'm good

739
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:15,621
What a guy, ha-ha, Monsieur Hood

740
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:16,664
Break it down

741
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,628
I like an honest fight
and a saucy little maid

742
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:25,588
What he's basically saying is he likes to
get...paid

743
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,923
So, when an ogre in the bush
grabs a lady by the tush

744
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:30,092
That's bad, that's bad,
that's bad, that's bad

745
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:32,886
When a beauty's with a beast
it makes me awfully mad

746
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:34,512
He's mad, he's really mad

747
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,723
Now I'll take my blade and
ram it through your heart

748
00:52:36,764 --> 00:52:40,726
Keep your eyes on me, boys,
'Cause I'm about to staaar-

749
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:49,484
Man, that was annoying.

750
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:54,030
Oh, you little...

751
00:53:20,385 --> 00:53:23,055
Shall we?

752
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:27,099
???all the forin???

753
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,353
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?

754
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:34,232
-What?
-That. Back there. That was amazing.

755
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:35,774
Where did you learn that?

756
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:41,528
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn
these things in case there's a...

757
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:43,365
There is an arrow in your but.

758
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,242
What? Oh, would you look at that.

759
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:49,370
Oh, no... This is all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

760
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,247
-What's wrong?
-Shrek's hurt.
-Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!

761
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,792
-Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
-Donkey, I'm ok.

762
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,418
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

763
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,003
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head down.

764
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:03,256
-Does anyone know how to handle...
-Donkey! Calm down.

765
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:07,802
If you want to help Shrek,
run into woods and find me
a blue flower with red thorns.

766
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:12,389
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

767
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:14,933
Don't die Shrek.
And if you see a long tunnel,
stay away from the light!

768
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:19,103
-Donkey!
-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

769
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:23,232
-What are the flowers for?
-For getting rid of Donkey.

770
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,734
Now, you hold still
and I'll yank this thing out.

771
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:29,821
-Hey! Easy with the yanking.
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

772
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:33,448
No, no. It's tender.
What you're doing here is the opposite...

773
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:39,996
-Don't move.
-Ok, look. Time out.
-Would you... Ok.

774
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:42,248
What do you propose we do?

775
00:54:42,456 --> 00:54:44,584
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

776
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:47,003
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colorblind.

777
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,129
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

778
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:52,716
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!

779
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,136
Not good.

780
00:54:56,343 --> 00:55:00,681
Ok, ok, I can lose it.
It's just about it.

781
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:06,311
Nothing happened.

782
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:08,187
We were just a...

783
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,149
Look if you want to be alone,
all you had to do is ask, ok?

784
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,776
Oh, come on.
That's the last thing on my mind.

785
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:19,322
The princess here was just... Au!

786
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:28,371
Hey, what's that? Is that...

787
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:47,305
My beloved monster and me

788
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:51,892
We go everywhere together

789
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:57,314
Wearing a raincoat
that has four sleeves

790
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:01,900
Gets us through
all kinds of weather

791
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,321
She will always be
the only thing

792
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,492
That comes between me
and the awful sting

793
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:18,581
That comes from living in a world
that's so damn mean

794
00:56:58,408 --> 00:57:00,577
There it is, princess.

795
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:03,579
-Your future awaits you.
-That's Duloc?

796
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:07,624
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things
lord Farquaad is compensating for something,

797
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:09,292
which I think needs, he has a

798
00:57:12,044 --> 00:57:13,753
I guess we better move on.

799
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:18,301
Sure, but Shrek...

800
00:57:18,426 --> 00:57:20,010
-I'm worried about Donkey.
-What?

801
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,721
I mean. Look at him.
He doesn't look so good.

802
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:26,432
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.
-Well, that's what they always say.

803
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:30,603
And the next thing you know
you're on your back.

804
00:57:30,853 --> 00:57:33,980
-Dead!
-You know she's right.
You look awful.

805
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:37,442
-Do you want to sit down?
-You know, I'll make you up some tea.

806
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,901
Well, I won't say nothing, but

807
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:42,446
I've got this twinge in my neck.
And if I turn my neck like this,
look. Au, see?

808
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:44,364
-He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.

809
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:47,409
-I'll get the firewood.
Hey, where are you going?

810
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,162
Oh man, I can't feel my toes.
I don't have any toe!!!

811
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:56,082
I think I need a hug.

812
00:58:02,755 --> 00:58:07,050
This is good.
This is really good.

813
00:58:07,759 --> 00:58:10,637
-What is this?
-Wheat rat.

814
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:15,225
-Rotisserie style.
-No kidding.

815
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,769
-Oh, this is delicious.
-Well, they also great in stews.

816
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:23,356
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean wheat rat stew.

817
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,906
I guess I'll be dining a little different
late tomorrow night.

818
00:58:32,656 --> 00:58:36,076
Maybe you can come visit me
in the swamp sometime.

819
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:38,536
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

820
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:43,081
Swamp toad soup, fish, eye tartar.
You name it.

821
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,919
I'd like that.

822
00:58:55,008 --> 00:59:02,223
-Ah... , princess?
-Yes, Shrek?

823
00:59:03,558 --> 00:59:07,143
I'm a.... I was wondering.

824
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:11,690
Are you... a...

825
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:16,819
Are you gonna eat that?

826
00:59:21,322 --> 00:59:24,409
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.

827
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:28,996
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late.
It's very late.

828
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:33,292
-What?
-Wait a minute.
I see what's going on here.

829
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:35,293
You're afraid of the dark.
Aren't you?

830
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:39,839
Yes, yes. That's it.
That's, I'm terrified.
You know I'll better go inside.

831
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:42,591
But don't feel bad, princess.
I used to be afraid of the dark too.

832
00:59:42,841 --> 00:59:47,137
Until... Hey, no, wait.
I'm still afraid of the dark.

833
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:52,433
-Good night.
-Good night.

834
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:58,606
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.

835
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:00,607
Oh, what are you talking about.

836
01:00:00,732 --> 01:00:02,942
Hey I don't wanna even hear.
Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts.

837
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:05,445
And I know that you two are digging on each other.
I can feel it.

838
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:09,948
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

839
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,367
Oh, come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

840
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:15,203
Just go in there
and tell her how you feel.

841
01:00:15,453 --> 01:00:19,749
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that...
well you know.

842
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:24,920
I'm not saying that I do,
'cause I don't.

843
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,756
She's a princess and I'm...

844
01:00:27,964 --> 01:00:30,217
...an Ogre.

845
01:00:30,466 --> 01:00:33,176
Yeah, an Ogre.

846
01:00:33,385 --> 01:00:37,680
-Hey, where are you going?
-To get more firewood.

847
01:00:56,364 --> 01:01:00,659
Princess. Princess Fiona?

848
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:09,708
Princess, where are you?

849
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,382
Princess?

850
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:23,387
It's very spooky in here
and are we playing little games.

851
01:01:32,686 --> 01:01:35,397
-No, no.
-Help! Shrek! Shrek!

852
01:01:35,689 --> 01:01:37,315
-No. -Shrek!
-It's ok. It's ok.

853
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:40,610
-What did you do with the princess?
-Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

854
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:45,155
-It's me, in this body.
-Oh my god. You ate the princess.

855
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:47,032
-Can you hear me?
-Donkey!

856
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:50,451
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there!

857
01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:53,413
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

858
01:01:53,705 --> 01:01:58,001
This is me.

859
01:02:00,294 --> 01:02:04,172
Princess? What happened to you?

860
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:08,008
You're a... different.

861
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:10,303
-I'm ugly, ok?
-Yeah.

862
01:02:10,344 --> 01:02:13,597
Was it something that you ate?
'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.

863
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:19,101
-You are what you eat, I say.
-No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.

864
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:22,354
What do you mean?
Look, I've never seen you like this before.

865
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:26,900
It only happens when the sun goes down.

866
01:02:27,066 --> 01:02:35,032
By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm
until you find true love's first kiss.

867
01:02:36,325 --> 01:02:40,621
Then, take love's true form...

868
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,248
-Oh, that's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

869
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,542
-It's a spell.

870
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:51,671
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

871
01:02:51,922 --> 01:02:56,218
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.

872
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:05,267
I was placed in a tower to await the day
when my true love would rescue me.

873
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:13,065
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow,
before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?

874
01:03:15,943 --> 01:03:20,238
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

875
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:24,658
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.

876
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:26,827
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

877
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:32,374
But Donkey, I'm a princess.
And this is not how a princess is meant to look.

878
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:37,794
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?

879
01:03:38,003 --> 01:03:42,298
I have to.
Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.

880
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:46,385
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

881
01:03:46,678 --> 01:03:49,847
And Shrek...
Well you've got a lot in common.

882
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:51,557
Shrek?

883
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:58,103
Princess, I... How is it going first of all?
Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

884
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:03,817
I saw this flower
and thought of you because it's pretty.

885
01:04:04,025 --> 01:04:09,322
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you may like it, because you're pretty.

886
01:04:10,031 --> 01:04:14,326
But I like you anyway. A....

887
01:04:14,994 --> 01:04:19,289
I'm in trouble.
Ok, here we go.

888
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:29,756
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly?
Princess and ugly don't go together.

889
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:36,679
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek,

890
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:37,722
but only chance to live happily ever after
is to marry my true love.

891
01:04:39,473 --> 01:04:43,727
Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

892
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,771
It's the only way to break the spell.

893
01:04:47,856 --> 01:04:49,773
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.

894
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:52,860
No, no. You can't breathe the word.
No one must ever know.

895
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:55,570
What's the point of being unable to talk?
You got to keep secrets.

896
01:04:55,778 --> 01:04:58,031
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

897
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:02,618
All right, all right.
I won't tell him. But you should.

898
01:05:01,992 --> 01:05:04,786
You know, before this is over,
I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.

899
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:09,333
Look at my eye twitching.

900
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:35,939
I tell him,
I tell him not.

901
01:05:36,105 --> 01:05:39,942
I tell him.
I tell him not.

902
01:05:40,192 --> 01:05:41,777
I tell him!

903
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:46,280
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ...

904
01:06:07,966 --> 01:06:11,845
Shrek. Are you all right?

905
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,722
Perfect. Never been better.

906
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:18,267
I... There's something I have to tell you.

907
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:22,270
You don't have to tell me anything, princess.
I heard enough last night.

908
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:25,398
-You've heard what I said?
-Every word.

909
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,691
I thought you'd understand?

910
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:32,195
Oh, I understand!
Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!

911
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:38,409
-I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
-Yeah, well, it does.

912
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:45,165
Ah, right on time. Princess.
I brought you a little something.

913
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:55,465
What I missed?  What I missed?

914
01:06:57,885 --> 01:07:02,180
-Princess Fiona.
-As promised. Now hand it over.

915
01:07:02,763 --> 01:07:08,059
Very well, Ogre.
The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

916
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:12,021
Before I change my mind.

917
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:16,609
Forgive me princess for startling you,
but you startled me.

918
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:20,361
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.

919
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:24,908
-I am lord Farquaad.
-Lord Farquaad?

920
01:07:26,493 --> 01:07:35,500
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.

921
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:40,254
Oh. That is so sweet.
You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.

922
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:45,550
-It's not like it has feelings.
-No. You're right. It doesn't.

923
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:51,222
Princess Fiona,
beautiful fair flawless Fiona,

924
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:57,770
I ask your hand in marriage.
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

925
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:07,361
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

926
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:11,115
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...

927
01:08:11,365 --> 01:08:15,243
No! I mean I... Why wait?

928
01:08:15,493 --> 01:08:19,372
Let's get married today.
Before sunset.

929
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:23,208
Oh, anxious are we?
You're right. The sooner, the better.

930
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,960
There's so much to do.

931
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:30,881
There is the camera,
the cake, the band, the guests...
Captain! Round up some guests.

932
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,385
Farewell Ogre.

933
01:08:34,593 --> 01:08:36,678
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.

934
01:08:36,971 --> 01:08:40,849
-Yeah, so what.
-Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.

935
01:08:41,099 --> 01:08:44,810
-I talked to her last night. She's...
-Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

936
01:08:45,018 --> 01:08:49,314
You're great pal, aren't you?
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why didn't you follow her home?

937
01:08:50,232 --> 01:08:53,317
-Shrek. I want to go with you.
-I told you, didn't I?

938
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:58,864
You're not coming home with me.
I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!

939
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:05,954
Understand? Nobody!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying,
talking donkeys!

940
01:09:06,996 --> 01:09:11,291
-But. I thought...
-Yeah. You know what?
You thought wrong.

941
01:09:13,836 --> 01:09:16,463
Shrek.

942
01:09:21,342 --> 01:09:25,220
I've heard there was a secret chord

943
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:28,556
That David played,
and it pleased the Lord

944
01:09:28,848 --> 01:09:32,727
But you don't really care for music,
do you?

945
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:38,147
It goes like this:
the fourth, the fifth

946
01:09:38,856 --> 01:09:41,067
The minor fall,
the major lift

947
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:46,113
The baffled king
composing Hallelujah

948
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:53,578
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

949
01:09:55,121 --> 01:10:01,919
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

950
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,174
Baby, I've been here before

951
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:11,928
I know this room,
I've walked this floor

952
01:10:10,968 --> 01:10:16,932
I used to live alone
before I knew you

953
01:10:18,642 --> 01:10:22,603
I've seen your flag
on the marble arch

954
01:10:22,644 --> 01:10:25,272
Love is not a victory march

955
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:31,110
It's a cold
and it's a broken Hallelujah

956
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:38,033
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

957
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:45,706
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

958
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:52,379
And all I ever learned from love

959
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,383
Was how to shoot at someone
who outdrew you

960
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:02,388
It's not a cry
you can hear at night

961
01:11:02,263 --> 01:11:04,890
It's not somebody
who's seen the light

962
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:11,145
It's a cold
and it's a broken Hallelujah

963
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:17,817
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

964
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:27,826
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

965
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,003
Donkey?

966
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,128
What are you doing?

967
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:43,465
I was thinking of all the people,
you would recognize a wall
when you see one.

968
01:11:43,715 --> 01:11:48,594
Well, yeah.
But the wall supposed to go around my swamp.
Not through it.

969
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,346
It is around your half.
See? That's your half and this is my half.

970
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:54,223
Oh, your half?

971
01:11:54,474 --> 01:11:57,352
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

972
01:11:57,602 --> 01:12:00,146
I did half the work.
I get half the booty.

973
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:02,023
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head

974
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:05,233
-Back off!
-No. You back off!

975
01:12:05,484 --> 01:12:07,194
-This is my swamp.
-Our swamp.

976
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:09,028
-Let go, Donkey!
-You let go!

977
01:12:09,236 --> 01:12:11,072
-Stubborn jackass.
-Smelly Ogre.

978
01:12:11,323 --> 01:12:13,240
Fine!

979
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:15,659
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.

980
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:20,205
-Well, I'm through with you!
-Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.

981
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:22,748
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!

982
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:26,627
So you just shut up and pay attention!

983
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:29,922
You are mean to me, you insult me,
you don't appreciate anything that I do!

984
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:32,340
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

985
01:12:32,632 --> 01:12:36,927
Oh, yeah?
Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

986
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:40,472
Because that's what friends do.
They forgive each other!

987
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,435
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey.
I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!

988
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:53,483
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy.
You're afraid of your own feelings.

989
01:12:53,692 --> 01:12:56,945
-Go away.
-See? There you are, doing it again.
Just like you did it to Fiona.

990
01:12:57,195 --> 01:12:59,406
And all she ever do, was like you.
Maybe even love you.

991
01:12:59,656 --> 01:13:02,033
Love me?
She said I was ugly!

992
01:13:02,074 --> 01:13:04,118
A hideous creature.

993
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,078
-I heard that you two were talking.

994
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,162
-She wasn't talking about you.

995
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:09,122
She was talking about...

996
01:13:09,164 --> 01:13:12,291
...somebody else.

997
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:17,129
She wasn't talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?

998
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:21,298
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?

999
01:13:21,549 --> 01:13:23,844
-Donkey.
-No!

1000
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:28,431
Ok, look.
I'm sorry, all right?

1001
01:13:34,435 --> 01:13:36,020
I'm sorry.

1002
01:13:36,271 --> 01:13:40,566
I guess I am just a big stupid,
ugly Ogre.

1003
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:45,737
Can you forgive me?

1004
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:48,989
-Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
-Right.

1005
01:13:49,282 --> 01:13:52,744
-Friends?
-Friends.

1006
01:13:52,993 --> 01:13:57,289
So? What did Fiona said about me?

1007
01:13:58,414 --> 01:14:01,125
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.

1008
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:04,879
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!

1009
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:07,131
Never fear! For where there is a will,
there is a way.

1010
01:14:07,338 --> 01:14:11,634
And I have a way.

1011
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:16,597
Donkey?

1012
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:22,143
-I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
-Oh, come here, you.

1013
01:14:22,351 --> 01:14:25,313
All right. All right.
Don't get all started.
No one likes kiss an ass.

1014
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:27,356
All right, hop on.
Hold on tight.

1015
01:14:27,606 --> 01:14:31,902
I hadn't have a chance
to install seat belts, yet.

1016
01:15:02,637 --> 01:15:12,937
People of Duloc. We gather here today
to bear witness to reunion of our new king...

1017
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:17,400
Excuse me.
Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?

1018
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:21,403
Go on.

1019
01:15:23,655 --> 01:15:29,952
Go ahead and have some fun,
if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

1020
01:15:31,245 --> 01:15:33,664
Shrek, wait, wait a minute.
You want to do this right, don't you?

1021
01:15:33,872 --> 01:15:36,999
-What are you talking about?
-It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

1022
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,544
The priest is going to say:
"Speak now or forever hold your peace".

1023
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:42,130
And that's where you say: "I object".

1024
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:45,507
-I don't have time for this.
-Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

1025
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:46,967
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

1026
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,134
-Yes.
-You want to hold her!

1027
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:50,554
-Yes.
-Please her!
-Yes!

1028
01:15:50,804 --> 01:15:53,889
Then you got to,
got to try a little tenderness.

1029
01:15:54,056 --> 01:15:58,436
-The chicks love that romantic crap.
-All right. Cut it out.
When does this guy say the line?

1030
01:15:59,395 --> 01:16:01,020
We got to check it out.

1031
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:04,149
And as so by the power vested in me...

1032
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:06,108
What do you see?

1033
01:16:06,317 --> 01:16:10,612
-I now pronounce you...
-There they go!

1034
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:16,617
-...he already said it.
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

1035
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:19,454
I object!

1036
01:16:19,745 --> 01:16:21,288
Shrek?

1037
01:16:21,496 --> 01:16:25,833
Oh, now what does he want?

1038
01:16:26,876 --> 01:16:30,838
Hi, everyone.
Having a good time, aren't you?

1039
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:32,756
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

1040
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:37,303
-What are you doing here?
-Really, it's rude enough being alive,
when no one wants you.

1041
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:39,721
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

1042
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:44,225
-Fiona! I need to talk to you.
-Oh, now you wanna talk?

1043
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,019
Well it's a little late for that.
So if you'll excuse me.

1044
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,771
-But you can't marry him!
-And why not?

1045
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:54,317
Because, because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.

1046
01:16:54,317 --> 01:16:57,736
-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
-He's not your true love.

1047
01:16:57,945 --> 01:17:03,575
-What do you know about true love?
-Well, I ...I'm in...

1048
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:06,911
Oh, this is precious.

1049
01:17:07,203 --> 01:17:11,498
The Ogre has fallen in love
with the princess.

1050
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:16,336
Laugh.

1051
01:17:20,547 --> 01:17:23,884
Shrek. Is this true?

1052
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:26,345
Who cares.
It's preposterous.

1053
01:17:27,638 --> 01:17:31,391
Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away
for our happily ever after.

1054
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:33,892
Now kiss me!

1055
01:17:38,063 --> 01:17:42,358
By night one way,
by day another.

1056
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,822
I wanted to show you before.

1057
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:13,385
Well. That explains a lot.

1058
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:19,724
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards.
I order you to get them out of my sight.

1059
01:18:20,558 --> 01:18:24,853
-Now! Get them! Get them, both!
-No!

1060
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,275
This marriage is minding,
and that makes me king. See? See?

1061
01:18:30,316 --> 01:18:31,693
-Shrek!
-No.

1062
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:36,196
-Don't just stand there, you dogs.
-Get out of my way.

1063
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:47,039
No! Shrek!

1064
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,584
-And as for you my wife.
-Fiona!

1065
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:54,129
I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

1066
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:59,300
I will have order.
I will have potential.
I will have...

1067
01:19:04,763 --> 01:19:09,059
All right, nobody move!
I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.

1068
01:19:09,475 --> 01:19:13,771
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1069
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:19,442
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1070
01:19:20,818 --> 01:19:24,197
Go ahead Shrek.

1071
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:28,742
-Fiona?
-Yes, Shrek?

1072
01:19:29,076 --> 01:19:33,372
I love you.

1073
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:36,207
Really?

1074
01:19:36,457 --> 01:19:39,834
Really, really.

1075
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:44,381
I love you too.

1076
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:55,515
A time for true love's first kiss...

1077
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:34,424
Fiona?

1078
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:39,303
Fiona? Are you all right?

1079
01:20:41,179 --> 01:20:45,141
Yes. But I don't understand.

1080
01:20:45,434 --> 01:20:49,729
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1081
01:20:50,438 --> 01:20:54,733
But you are beautiful.

1082
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:59,029
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

1083
01:21:01,113 --> 01:21:06,535
I thought love was only true in fairy tales

1084
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:10,288
Meant for someone else but not for me

1085
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:15,710
Love was out to get to me

1086
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,211
That's the way it seems

1087
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:22,382
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

1088
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:25,301
And then I saw her face

1089
01:21:26,844 --> 01:21:28,637
Now I'm a believer

1090
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,973
Not a trace

1091
01:21:32,432 --> 01:21:34,476
Of doubt in my mind

1092
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:38,645
I'm in love

1093
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:40,732
I'm a believer

1094
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:43,566
I couldn't leave her if I tried

1095
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:48,780
God bless us, everyone.

1096
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:57,006
The End.

1097
01:23:01,175 --> 01:23:02,427
I can't breath. I can't breath.
